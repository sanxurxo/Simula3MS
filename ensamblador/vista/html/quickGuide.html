This guide summarizes the basic steps to begin working with Simula3MS.
<ol>

<li> When Simula3MS is executed, an editor window appears, that allows:</li>
<ul>
        <li>the load of a previously edited file</li>
        <li>the edition of a new assemble language code</li>
</ul>
  
<li> Once the code is edited (or loaded), use the Assemble button. Two results are
possible:</li>
	<ul>
        <li>If the code does not have any syntactic errors, the Execute button becomes
        enabled to give access to the simulation.</li>
        <li>In case the code is not correct, a list with all the errors will appear at the bottom
        of the window. The first error is highlighted. Next errors can be found using
        Next error button. When all these errors have been corrected, repeat step 2.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Choose a configuration to execute the code. There are three possible options in the
Configuration menu: Input/Output, Datapath and Branch techniques.</li>
	<ul>
        <li>Input/Output. The I/O is by default deactivated. To simulate I/O choose
        Polling or Input/Output with Interrupts.</li>
        <li>Datapath. The selected option by default is the Monocycle datapath. Selecting
        Multicycle or any implementation of the Pipeline processor, a new window
        will be opened, allowing to configure the latency of the floating point
        operations.</li>
        <li>Branch techniques. Currently Simula3MS allows the selection two branch
        techniques: Delayed branch and Fixed branch prediction. Both of them appear
        deactivated by default and the selection of any of these techniques forces the
        basic pipeline.</li>
	</ul>
<li> Use the Execute button to access to the simulation window. In this window, the
final result of the complete program execution is shown (using the Execute button), or
the evolution of each instruction in each cycle can be observed (using the Next cycle
and Previous cycle buttons).</li>
</ol>
